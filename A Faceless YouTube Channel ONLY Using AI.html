    <h1 style="color: blue;">How I Created A Faceless YouTube Channel ONLY Using AI</h1>
    <p>On average, YouTubers with faceless channels make between $12K and $120K per year, and the best part is that you don’t need fancy equipment or advanced editing skills.</p>
    <p>I always loved telling stories. I always had a passion for sharing my knowledge with the world. <br>

        But there was only one problem. <br>
        
        Being on camera always held me back! I don’t know why but doing makeup and smiling while talking on the camera was not the kind of the life I imagined. This one thing made me quit YouTube until I first heard about YouTube Automation. <br>
        
        After watching some of the videos on YouTube Automation, I got to know that building a successful YouTube channel is no longer a big deal. I create YouTube videos and no longer have to face the camera ever. <br>
        
        This sounds unrealistic. because I wanted proof that the Faceless channel still makes good money. <br>
        
        I had an old YouTube channel and going through my first video was not so much exciting. Writing scripts, making videos, and then a voice — over. I am not a video editing expert. Hiring someone to edit each video can be very expensive. <br>
        
        But since people are going faceless/voiceless using AI, I decided to give it a try. <br>
        
        If you’re also excited to earn big money as an AI YouTuber, keep reading to find out the step-by-step guide on how to create faceless YouTube channel using AI in this blog!</p>

        <h1 style="color: blue;">Step 1: Define Niche for Your Faceless AI YouTube Channel</h1>
        <p>So starting a faceless YouTube channel with AI can be a bit confusing at first. The idea was a little bit off for me because I never knew what topic should I go for. Most of the videos I watch were mostly with YouTubers on the screen. <br>

        But here’s what I learned from Faceless YouTube Automation: when you’re picking what to make videos about, just go for something you really love! It could be anything you’re super interested in. That way, you’ll enjoy making the videos, and that passion will help you succeed. <br>

        Again confused? I have listed some Faceless channel ideas for you — 10 RARELY used YouTube Channel Ideas — No Voice, No Face <br>

        I didn’t come up with many topics of my liking. I wanted something related to tech because I graduated in the tech field. So being in this will help me a lot to come up with various topics. <br>

        But YouTube and Google were not very useful to me. I decided to go for ChatGPT. <br>

        If you’re not sure what to do for yours, just ask ChatGPT! You can say something like “Hey ChatGPT, give me 100 ideas for a faceless YouTube channel about automation.” It’ll give you tons of ideas for your AI YouTuber.
    
        I filtered through these 100 ideas and shortlisted only 10 of them. It was hard but worth it. I picked only the ones which have less competition and I really love to do it. This means, I do want to make money but also enjoy along the way. <br>

        One of the best example is — YouTuber Jensen Tung chose “Facts & trivia” after consulting ChatGPT for his AI YouTuber experiments; Mission To The Loot went for “horror stories” for his AI YouTube channel.</p>

        <h1 style="color: blue;">Step 2: Create Your YouTube Bio with ChatGPT and AI Image Generator</h1>

        <p>My YouTube bio is where I build my personal brand with key details. To leave a good impression on my audience, I have an eye-catching profile picture, a unique banner (I used Canva for this), and a short to-the-point description. I have only one line of description telling what my channel is about. That’s not. No essays here.</p>

        <h2 style="color: blue;">How to Use ChatGPT to Create Your YouTube Bio Name & Description?</h2>
        <p>You can use ChatGPT to help you with the channel name and a good description. I didn’t used ChatGPT but if you are in a hurry then use it to save some time. <br>

        Try to answer this question before using ChatGPT — <br>

        What is your AI YouTube channel about? <br>
        What style is fit for the name and the description of your account? Serious or funny? <br>
        How to represent your brand in your name and description in a unique way? <br>
        I am definitely sure ChatGPT will come up with some good names. Use one of them. Also, remember that this is not permanent in case you didn’t get one. I changed my Channel name 3 times already! Now I have the perfect one. I am sure you’ll get yours too!</p>

        <h2 style="color: blue;">How to Use an AI Image Generator to Create Your YouTube Bio Pic & Banner?</h2>
        <p>As a faceless YouTube channel creator, I also need a powerful AI image generator like Stable Diffusion or Midjourney to help me stay anonymous. I just entered a few descriptive words into these AI image tools. Results? I got a stunning and original picture that might otherwise cost me a hundred dollars if bought from a professional designer. <br>

        I have one Faceless channel where I have used Midjourney. while for my Faceless Voiceless Channel I have simply used Canva. The choice is completely yours. You can choose any you like. Just make sure the image is unique. <br>

        After you get the image, make sure you edit the size of the photo using Canva. <br>

        If you are using Canva like me then no need to worry further. You are all settled!</p>

        <h1 style="color: blue;">Step 3: Use ChatGPT to Write the Script for Your YouTube Video </h1>

        <p>Now the channel is up and running. <br>

        But this is not what got me worried. I still have to make my videos to get viewers attention. <br>

        But before that, I needed a script for my Faceless AI YouTube channel. <br>

        I will admit here that I never adored scriptwriting. That’s the reason I went for ebook writing. Much easier than to write scripts. Just my opinion. <br>

        One pattern I have seen is that people watch my videos with the expectation of being entertained or educated. This is true with both of my YouTube channels. I have channels in education and Tech so cannot say about other categories. So providing quality content consistently is the key here. I should not miss this part. <br>

        I would like to try my hands in script writing someday, but for now, I am totally dependent on AI. I mean writing a blog post (draft stage) takes almost 10 minutes. Then editing it takes even more time. I cannot do that with YouTube. It’s my side hustle after all. <br>

        I would simply enter the topic of my script and ChatGPT generates an attention-grabbing story in a few seconds. <br>

        Most of my YouTube videos are “How-To” tutorials so ChatGPT is very much useful for this. <br>

        I always liked scripts that in in-depth. So I keep on editing it until I get a proper tone. I want the script to solve a particular problem. Not some plain wiki text. I always make sure that I keep the tutorial in-depth and answers my viewer’s queries as much as possible. <br>

        Whenever I am in doubt, i simply do one thing. <br>

        I see what my competitors are doing. I take inspiration from them and then keep on improving my script. <br>

        My first script took me the whole day because I wasn’t good at using AI. But it’s getting better now. <br>

        Also, make sure that information is up to date. Check for facts as well.</p>

        <h1 style="color: blue;">Step 4: Pick a Voice Generator for Your AI Faceless YouTube Channel</h1>

        <p>When I create YouTube videos with a good voice-over, it helps build my brand image, engages with my audience, and achieves better ROI. Thanks to the development of AI, I no longer need to worry about the cost of a professional voice-over. Instead, I can simply turn to my free AI voice-over generator in any language and tone easily with text-to-speech software for free.</p>

        <h1 style="color: blue;">Step 5: Generate Visuals with a Faceless AI Video Generator</h1>

        <p>I am an AI YouTuber. Most of my videos are made using AI. But this applies to traditional YouTubers as well. for both of us, visuals are everything. In this age of AI, it’s much more efficient for me to create quality videos. There are many tools out there to do so.</p>

        <h1 style="color: blue;">Step 6: Improve Quality with AI Video Enhancer</h1>
        <p>Note — This is not needed in case you are have a Faceless/Voiceless Channel like me <br>

        Despite the faceless video AI generator, I can either enhance my recorded videos with an AI video upscaler or generate videos from texts using an AI video generator to incorporate different videos piece by piece. I have used this only once. Honestly, I haven’t seen any changes much to this.</p>

        <h1 style="color: blue;">Step 7: Add Music to AI YouTube Video Using AI Music Generator</h1>

        <p>I don’t think it’s necessary to add background music in every video. However, when I do it right, it evokes my audience’s emotions, creates rhythms for my clips and scenes, and sets the tone of my video. Using AI music generators gives me the opportunity to create original music that is preferred by the YouTube algorithm. Some popular AI music apps I use are Strofe, Soundraw, Soundful, etc. <br>

        The AI music generator lets me create a piece of music in various genres, such as hip hop, R&B, rock, house, and more. I can select the music mood, theme, tempo, and instruments to generate the perfect music that suits my YouTube video, ranging from 10 seconds to 5 minutes in length.</p>

        <h1 style="color: blue;">Step 8: Create Video Captions for Your AI YouTube Channel</h1>
        <p>Most of my videos are voiceless. So I don’t need a caption for that. But whatever tool you use, they already have a caption feature for you. <br>

        Not necessary. I haven’t used this yet. So cannot comment. <br>

        <h1 style="color: blue;">Step 9: Edit Your Faceless AI YouTube Video & Upload</h1>
        <p>I used OpenShot to edit my videos one final time. <br>


        Your AI YouTube channel is almost done. The last step is to polish your faceless AI YouTube video with some editing. <br>

        <h2 style="color: blue;">What is an AI YouTube channel?</h2>
        <p>An artificial intelligence (AI) YouTube channel is one that specializes on news and resources about AI, including mindmaps, movies, and algorithms, that may be used by businesses and industries of all kinds. Some well-known AI YouTube channels you might want to check out are: Applied AI Course, Henry AI Labs, Deep Learning AI, and so on.</p>

        <h2 style="color: blue;">Why start an AI Faceless YouTube channel?</h2>
        <p>Faceless YouTube channels using artificial intelligence (AI) have become popular, allowing users to escape camera shyness and unwanted attention from friends and strangers by using their own faces in videos instead of drawing the audience’s attention to the content. It also symbolizes the cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology that is frequently used in video production.</p>
